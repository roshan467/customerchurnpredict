Customer Churn Prediction & Retention
 Project Overview

https://customer-churn-rete-qqepexaw3tz9czgqybyfez.streamlit.app/#customer-churn-prediction
 

Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges faced by businesses. This project focuses on predicting whether a customer is likely to churn (leave the company) using machine learning models, and provides insights to design retention strategies.

The system helps businesses:

Identify customers at risk of churn

Predict churn using historical customer data

Provide retention recommendations

 Features

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with churn insights

Machine Learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)

Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

Deployment-ready Flask/Streamlit app (app.py) for churn prediction

Retention strategy suggestions based on model output

 Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost

Deployment: Flask / Streamlit

Dataset: Telecom/Banking/Retail customer data (CSV)

 Project Workflow

Data Collection → Import customer dataset

Data Preprocessing → Handle missing values, encoding, scaling

EDA → Visualize churn patterns (income, tenure, services, complaints, etc.)

Model Training → Train ML models for churn prediction

Evaluation → Choose the best model based on metrics

Deployment → app.py allows real-time predictions

Retention Strategy → Recommend offers/discounts for at-risk customers
